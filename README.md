# Microsoft Landing Page Clone

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, I've cloned the landing page of Microsoft using HTML5, CSS3, and Tailwind CSS. 

## Description

This project aims to recreate the Microsoft landing page to practice front-end development skills. By utilizing HTML5 for structuring, CSS3 for styling, and Tailwind CSS for rapid prototyping and utility-first styling, I've aimed to make an accurate and visually appealing replica of the original page.

## Features

- HTML5: Used for structuring the content of the page.
- CSS3: Employed for styling elements and enhancing the visual appeal.
- Tailwind CSS: Leveraged for efficient styling and responsive design, making it easier to create a polished and modern interface.

  
## How to Use

1. Clone the repository
2. make sure you have node.js and npm is installed before running it.
3. I have used 'vite' here to run auto like live server.
4. Use command " npm run start ".
5. It will run vite server and you are good to go.
